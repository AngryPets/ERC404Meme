# TRC404: Next-gen Hybrid Memecoin Standard on Tron

## Introduction

TRC404 is an opinionated yet practical implementation of the [ERC404](https://github.com/Pandora-Labs-Org/erc404) standard, aimed at adding substantial value and utility to memecoins on EVM chains (like Tron) by enabling generative PFP NFT collections that are natively tied to them.

## Key Features

- **Generative PFP NFTs**: Each TRC404 token is part of a vast generative PFP NFT collection, providing unique character and identity to memecoins.
- **Enhanced Liquidity and Fractionalization**: Supports native liquidity on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, which enhances market fluidity and accessibility.
- **Modular Architecture**: Adopts the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) for modular design and efficient contract management.
- **Secure and Transparent Processes**: Utilizes onchain VRF to ensure fairness and reliability in token generation and NFT reveals.

## Distinctions from Legacy ERC404

- **Legacy ERC404**: Combines ERC721 and ERC20, where each token equals one NFT.
- **TRC404**: Merges generative PFPs with memecoins, where 10,000 tokens represent one NFT, utilizing onchain VRF for randomization and Automation for operational efficiency.


## How It Works

1. **Token Generation**: Each token corresponds to a unique PFP NFT with specific traits.
2. **Minting and Trading**: Tokens are minted and can be traded on decentralized exchanges, providing immediate liquidity and fractional ownership.
3. **Reveal Process**: NFT traits are securely and randomly revealed using VRF, enhancing user engagement and trust.
4. **Dynamic Interaction**: Tokens can be used within the ERC404 ecosystem for various interactions and transactions, providing a rich, user-centric experience.
